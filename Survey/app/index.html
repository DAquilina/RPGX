            <div class="preface">
              <p>
                Thank you for taking a break from your games at RPG Crossing to give us a hand. We
                promise not to take too much of your time.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                This survey is intended to help us better understand who is using the site and how
                we can best make everyone's time here as enjoyable as possible.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                None of the questions in this survey is required. If you would prefer not to
                answer, feel free to move on. Answers will be saved and loaded for you if you return,
                in case you would like to review or revise any of your answers.
              </p>

              <p>
                Any site member who completes this survey with more than 75% of questions answered
                will have one month added to their CS membership, current or purchased any time over the next
                year (including 1 month memberships.) This will be done automatically, with a check each day. A maximum of one month
                will be added to any account.
              </p>

              <p>
                The survey will be open for the month of July, 2016.
              </p>
