              <p>
                Thank you for taking a break from your games at RPG Crossing to give us a hand. We
                promise not to take too much of your time.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                This survey is intended to help us better understand who is using the site and how
                we can best make everyone's time here as enjoyable as possible.
                None of the questions in this survey is required. If you would prefer not to
                answer, feel free to move on. Answers will be saved and loaded for you if you return,
                in case you would like to review or revise your entries.
              </p>

              <p>
                The survey should only take around 5 to 10 minutes, and anyone who completes at least 75% 
                of the survey by July 31, 2016 will have <strong>a free month of CS</strong>
                added to their current CS membership within two days.*
